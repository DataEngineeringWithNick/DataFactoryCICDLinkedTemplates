This video goes over how to write code to package up and promote a DEV Azure Data Factory to a UAT Data Factory and PROD Data Factory using Linked ARM Templates via a new Linked Template Specs process

Linked Templates are needed when your Data Factory size is over 4MB. This process goes over how to deploy large Data Factories

If your Data Factory size is under 4MB, use the normal CI/CD process here: [Data Factory Normal CI/CD YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/l-bBMelqifw) and reference this code base: [Data Factory Normal CI/CD GitHub Repo](https://github.com/DataEngineeringWithNick/DataFactoryCICD)
